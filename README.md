## Self wisdom

Self wisdom is my personal project that aims to improve my memory and active knowledge and keep it active long-term

My goal is to achive this possibility by categorizing knowledge creating stuff that I probably need to remember in the future and the main goal is to never forget/ actually learn the content in the best possible way, inspired in the chinese learning system that all the contents learnt will keep coming back in the tests or exams to ensure it was active learnt instead of just being something that happened and will fall in the lost knowledge graveyard

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```
